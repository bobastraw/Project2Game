    <h1>Attic</h1>

    <p>You reach for the rope to the stairs of the attic and they come down. They're steep but you
        manage to make it up into the attic. It is pitch black. You turn on your flashlight to try to 
        find a lightswtich but before you could walk in further, You're falling backwards. You've been 
        pushed. Your head hits the ground and your vision starts to blur. Through the haze you see the 
        shape of a man on top of the attic stairs. In his hand theres a gun. You lose consciousness...</p>
