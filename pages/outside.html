    <h1>Outside</h1>

    <p>There is a backdoor in the kitchen leading out to the backyard, you go to open it and 
        notice the doorknob is wet. It is dark outside so you turn on your flashlight and look around,
        there doesnt seem to be anything that could have made the sound but you do notice a shed.
        Do you: investigate the shed or go back inside?</p>
