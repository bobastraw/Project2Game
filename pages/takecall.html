    <h1>Take Call</h1>

    <p>You pick up, a body was found and you're needed at the scene of the crime 
        immediately. They'll send some officers to finish the wellfare check. You leave in a
        hurry. Later you find out that the blood you saw was not from the woman and she is still
        missing but is now presumed murdered. The officers did not find anymore evidence and the 
        case has gone cold. Looks like the killer got away...</p>
