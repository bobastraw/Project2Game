    <h1>Left Door</h1>

    <p>You open the door and are greeted by the body of the woman on the ground. Shes on her back 
        laying in a pool of blood. It appears she's been shot multiple times. You check her pulse, miraculously
        there is one. Immediately you call for backup and an ambulance. Backup arrives, they sweep
        the home and find a man in the attic and one in the shed. Their weapons were confiscated; a gun and
        a knife, the same one from the kitchen. Robbery gone wrong, they weren't expecting her to be 
        home. The woman was taken to the hospital, shes in critical condition but there is hope she is 
        going to make it.</p>
