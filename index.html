    <h1>Murder?</h1>


    
    <p>
        You're a detective and you've been sent to do a wellware check. It is on a woman who was supposed to 
        meet her mother upstate earlier that day but she failed to show up. She has not been answering her 
        phone and her mother is worried. You were in the area so you thought you might as well swing by.As you approach the house you notice that the door is cracked open. You walk in and notice 
        a lamp knocked over, a potted plant broken on the ground, and some blood on the ground indicating a 
        struggle.You need to gather more evidence. Do you: go towards the kitchen or upstairs?</p>
